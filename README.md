# Component-Homework
In class you learned about React and it's use of components to create modular web applications.

In this homework you have a basic calculator in a single component. You need to break the calculator into separate components and then use them in the App.js component. The size and organization of the components can be any way you like as long as it still creates the calculator.

*The calculator does not need to function.*

In order to run the app you will to run "npm install" to install the node modules and then to run the app run "npm run start" in the terminal.

When you have created the components then push your work back up to Github.
